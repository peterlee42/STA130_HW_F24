    "# Analysis 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question:\n",
    "- Does the frequency of engaging in vigorous sports, fitness, or recreational activities per week correlate with an individual's self-esteem regarding their body?\n",
    "\n",
    " and does this change between genders\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EXERCISE_global_physical_activity_questionnaire_leisure_vigorous_days (Independent Variable):\n",
    "- Ordinal Data\n",
    "- Measures how many days in a week (1-7) that you do vigorous exercise unrelated to work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PSYCH_self_esteem_unknown_scale_body (Dependent Variable):\n",
    "- Ordinal Data\n",
    "- Asks respondents to rate their self-esteem about their body, from 1 (not very true) to 7 (very true).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasoning:\n",
    "- Physical activity may be a key factor to how an individual feels about their own body.\n",
    "- I chose vigorous physical activities because I wanted to see if people who are athletic have some sort of correlation with one's own perception of their body.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizations:\n",
    "1. Bar Plot\n",
    "    - Good to visualize each variable independently since they are ordinal and discrete\n",
    "    - Will allow us to easily see frequency\n",
    "2. Side-by-side bar plot\n",
    "    - May be useful for comparison and may reveal any patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis (Spearman's Rank Correlation):\n",
    "- Predefined an alpha significance value of 0.05\n",
    "- I will calculate Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient to quantify the strength and direction of the association between these ordinal datasets.\n",
    "- To do this, we simply assign ranks to each value given by the variables\n",
    "- If there are repeating values, we give the average rank (ex. d=[3,3,4] would be ranked 1.5,1.5,3 respectively)\n",
    "- Then we calculate the p-value using an equation to form a conclusion as a form of hypothesis testing\n",
    "- If it is greater than alpha, then we are unlikely to reject the null hypothesis and if it is less, the we are likely to reject it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "- Monotonic Relationship: Assumes a monotonic relationship between the variables.\n",
    "- Independence: Each observation is assumed to be independent of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between the number of days of vigorous exercise and self esteem about one's body.\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant correlation between the number of days of vigorous exercise and self esteem about one's body.\n",
    "- I hypothesis that there will be a positive correlation since it is often understood that people who exercise typically have healthier bodies which may improve self esteem. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Possible Results\n",
    "- P-value <= 0.05 rejecting null hypothesis\n",
    "- P-value > 0.05 failing to reject null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance\n",
    "- We are able to understand whether or not vigorously exercising is overall better for individual's self esteem\n",
    "- If there is no correlation, there could be other factors beyond exercising that influences one's self perception of their body."
