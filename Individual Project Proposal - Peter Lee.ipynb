    "# Analysis 1\n",
    "## Research Question:\n",
    "- Does the frequency of engaging in vigorous sports, fitness, or recreational activities per week correlate with an individual's negative self-esteem regarding their body?\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "#### EXERCISE_global_physical_activity_questionnaire_leisure_vigorous_days (Independent Variable):\n",
    "- Measures how many days in a week (1-7) that you do vigorous exercise unrelated to work as ordinal response\n",
    "#### PSYCH_self_esteem_unknown_scale_body (Dependent Variable):\n",
    "- Asks respondents to rate their self-esteem about their body, from 1 (not very true) to 7 (very true) as an ordinal response.\n",
    "#### Reasoning:\n",
    "- Physical activity may be a key factor to how an individual feels about their own body and I want to see if it truly changes oneâ€™s self esteem.\n",
    "#### Visualization:\n",
    "Bar Plot\n",
    "- Good to visualize each variable independently since they are ordinal and discrete and lets us see frequency\n",
    "Scatter Plot\n",
    "- To see relationship between variables\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "1. Calculating the observed correlation (probably using Spearman's Rank or some method)\n",
    "2. Use permutation testing to randomly shuffle one of the variables to create a distribution of the correlation coefficient under the null hypothesis of no correlation\n",
    "3. I will compare observed correlation to null distribution and look at p-value to see significance and determine strength and sign of correlation to make a conclusion.\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "- Monotonic Relationship: Assumes a monotonic relationship between the variables.\n",
    "- Independence: Each observation is assumed to be independent of others.\n",
    "- Assumes observed data is the population\n",
    "### Hypothesis:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis: No correlation between vigorous activities and self esteem\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis: Is a correlation between vigorous activities and self esteem\n",
    "- I hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation since it is often understood that people who exercise have healthier bodies which may improve self esteem. However, it would be interesting to see the opposite.\n",
    "### Relevance\n",
    "- We are able to understand whether or not vigorously exercising is overall better for individual's self esteem"

    "# Analysis 2:\n",
    "### Research Question:\n",
    "-  Does the number of close friends correspond to feeling left out?\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "#### CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends_grouped (Independent)\n",
    "- Represents the number of close friends one has, grouped into the categories: None, 1-2, 3-4, 5 or more\n",
    "#### LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_left_out (Dependent)\n",
    "- Asks how often you feel left out with the options: Some of the time, Often, Hardly Ever\n",
    "##### Reasoning:\n",
    "- Often, it seems as though having more friends will always make you feel welcomed, but I wonder if having a greater number of close friends ends up making it more difficult to have a closer connection, leading to feeling left out.\n",
    "#### Visualizations:\n",
    "Bar Plot\n",
    "- Good to visualize each variable independently since they are ordinal and discrete\n",
    "- Will allow us to easily see frequency\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "1. Determine a alpha significance value of 0.05\n",
    "2. Construct a 4x3 contingency table such that each cell will contain the count of individuals that fall into the paired combination of each category\n",
    "3. Use Fisher's Exact Test to compute a significant p-value (using scipy.stats)\n",
    "4. Compare the computed p-value to the alpha significance value to determine if we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "5. Maybe look into permutation testing to find more interesting facts aobut the correlation if any exist.\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "- Data should be representative of the population\n",
    "- Each response is independent\n",
    "- Categories are mutually exclusive\n",
    "### Hypothesis:\n",
    "- H0: There is no relationship between the number of close friends and the frequency of feeling left out\n",
    "- HA: There is an association between the number of close friends and the frequency of feeling left out\n",
    "- I expect to see a correlation between the number of friends and feeling left out. since more connections means more opportunities to engage in activities.\n",
    "##### Possible Results\n",
    "- P-value <= 0.05 rejecting null hypothesis\n",
    "- P-value > 0.05 failing to reject null hypothesis\n",
    "### Relevance:\n",
    "- This analysis can show insights to whether the number of close friends is a great factor to feeling left out by looking at the correlation."

    "### Research Question:\n",
    "- Does being an introvert correlate with the frequency of having meaningful interactions?\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "#### CONNECTION_social_barriers_introvert (Independent)\n",
    "- Variables shows whether an individual is an introvert with the options: Introvert, not an introvert\n",
    "#### CONNECTION_meaningful_interactions (Dependent)\n",
    "- Represents the frequency of meaningful interactions with the options: every day, many times a day, many times a week, never, once or twice a month, once or twice a week, once or twice a year.\n",
    "##### Reasoning:\n",
    "- Introversion is a personality trait that may influence social interactions making it a good variable to see if it is relevent to having meaningful interactions, rather than \"small talk\"\n",
    "#### Visualizations:\n",
    "Bar Plot\n",
    "- Good to visualize each variable independently since they are ordinal and discrete\n",

    "- HA: There is a correlation between introversion and having meaningful interactions\n",
    "- I expect to see a correlation between introversion and meaningful interactions since introverted people typically need greater interest in speaking to people with reason rather than extroverted people who often speak to anyone.\n",
    "##### Possible Results\n",
    "- P-value <= 0.05 rejecting null hypothesis\n",
    "- P-value > 0.05 failing to reject null hypothesis\n",
    "### Relevance:\n",
    "- This can give insight as to whether introverted individuals seek or avoid meaningful social engagements which may be informative to helping improve social interactions for introverts."
